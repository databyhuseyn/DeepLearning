# Deep Learning with TensorFlow
Welcome to the Deep Learning with TensorFlow repository! This repository is dedicated to exploring deep learning concepts and techniques, particularly focusing on computer vision applications. With TensorFlow as the primary framework, this repository serves as a comprehensive resource for anyone looking to dive deep into neural networks and advanced deep learning models.

# Overview
This repository is designed for aspiring Computer Vision Specialists and deep learning enthusiasts. In this repository I share the models I created from scratch using academic papers and Tensorflow mostly. It covers a range of deep learning topics, from foundational neural network architectures to advanced models used in real-world computer vision tasks.

# Features
• Neural Network Basics: Introduction to building and training simple neural networks using TensorFlow and Keras.

• Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Implementations of CNNs for image classification, object detection, and segmentation tasks.

• Advanced Architectures: Explore state-of-the-art models such as:

  • ResNet

  • DenseNet
  
  • VGG
  
  • Inception
  
  • Vision Transformers (ViTs)
  
  • UNet for image segmentation
  
  • Recurrent UNET
  
  • Attention UNET
  
  • Siamese Networks for face verification
  
  • YOLO for real-time object detection
  
  • Transfer Learning: Leveraging pre-trained models for various tasks to achieve higher accuracy with less training data.
  
  • Data Augmentation: Techniques for artificially expanding the size and diversity of training datasets through random transformations, such as rotations, flips, zooms, and shifts.
  
  • Model Optimization: Techniques for improving model performance, including data augmentation, dropout, batch normalization, and learning rate scheduling.
  
  • Model Checkpoints: Saving model weights at specific checkpoints during training to prevent loss of progress and enable recovery from the best-performing epochs.
  
  • Automated Learning Rate Scheduling and Reducing: Using callbacks like ReduceLROnPlateau and learning rate schedulers to dynamically adjust the learning rate during training, improving convergence and avoiding plateaus.
  
  • Training and Evaluation: Detailed examples of training, validation, and testing models, including the use of metrics like accuracy, IoU, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
  
  • Deployment: Steps to deploy models for real-time inference in web and mobile applications.
